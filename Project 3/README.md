# Prosper Loan Dataset Exploration
## by (MAAROUFI Sirine)


## Dataset

> The dataset we're going to use in this project is Loan Data from Prosper. This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.


## Summary of Findings

After the exploratory analysis, I found: 
> Borrowers who have good prosper rating have an opportunity to avail lower borrower rates and at the same time, they can take higher loans.

> ProsperScore, ProsperRating,EstimatedReturn, EstimatedLoss, EstimatedEffectiveYield, LenderYield, BorrowerRate, and BorrowerAPR are strongly correlated between each other.

> ProsperRating is highly dependent on LoanOriginalAmount.

> BorrowerRate and BorrowerAPR are dependent on ProsperRating.

> LoanOriginalAmount is dependent on EmploymentStatus.
